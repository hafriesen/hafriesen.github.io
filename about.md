STUDENT
I am pursuing my B. Eng in Electrical Engineering at Dalhousie University. I completed the first two years of my degree at Acadia University, receiving a Certificate of Applied Science. 

BIOMEDEDICAL ENGINEERING
Currently, I am working at Sunnybrook Hospital in the Medventions Internship program. Previously, I was a summer research student at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital and the University of Toronto. 

DESIGNER
I create designs and handletter words. 

COMMUNITY-BUILDER 
I co-manage a social collective Instagram account [@socialcalligraphy](https://www.instagram.com/socialcalligraphy/). 


I thrive on challenging myself to learn new skills! Last year, I learned how to build a video game from scratch, design a 3D animated character, and code this website.
